There are two main problems with Never7 PC audio:  

1. All the PC versions have a horrible audio for voices and sound effects.
2. Download editions have a poorly implemented BGM, which makes it sound worse
than it actually is. In addition to that, tracks play in a wrong order.

This patch aims to fix both of these.  
(But you probably don't need 2nd part if you use English patch.)
