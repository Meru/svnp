#### Compatibility
*imhhw_retranslation_patch_v1.1.0.59* requires the following edition:  
`[2013-06-28] If My Heart Had Wings [Download|Package Edition]`, which is being
sold at MangaGamer.  
While it may work with Steam edition as well, we do not officially support it.  

**Notice:** Everything patches say after you launch them must be treated
literally. If they do not mention something, means this is not needed or should
not be done. For example, neither of the patches requires Japanese locale or
anything of that sort.
