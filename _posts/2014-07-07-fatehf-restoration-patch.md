This patch ports English translation from 『Fate/stay night』 (2004) to the 『Fate/stay night[Realta Nua] -Heaven's Feel-』 (2012) and restores removed content.  
None of the stuff specific to RealtaNua was removed in the process.  

+ Deleted or changed lines were restored to the state of the Fate/stay night 2004, while preserving all new Realta Nua effects, sounds etc.  
+ Some of the voices also restored. A lot of voices were removed in Realta Nua PC compared to PS2 version.  
+ Hentai and other sensitive scenes restored. First CG in first H-scene with Sakura was changed a bit (removed black corner).  
+ Shirou's voice enabled by default, nicer font for messages and history etc.  
+ As of r6, includes 53 tracks from "Realta Nua Soundtrack Reproduction" which are BGM from Realta Nua for PS Vita.  
+ As of r8, includes interactive on/off switching for H-scenes and/or uncensoring for them.  
+ As of r9, there should be no Japanese text left anywhere. (If there is - its a bug)
