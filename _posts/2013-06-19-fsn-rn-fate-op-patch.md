This patch replaces original opening in Fate/stay night[Realta Nua] -Fate- (PC)
to the new opening from Fate/stay night[Realta Nua] (PS Vita) Saber route version.  
It also adds high quality version of the original Fate/stay night[Realta Nua] (PS2)
opening (version with sound effects). Both videos have 720p resolution (though
older RN OP doesn't have much details anyway...)

Patch should be compatible with official updates.  
Compatibility with Fate/stay night Réalta Nua PC Patch by Waku Waku is possible,
but not guaranteed. Check readme for install instructions.  

This patch is obsolete. [Use this instead.]({{ "/realtanua-op-patch/" | prepend: site.baseurl}})
