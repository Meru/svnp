#### Updates
+ v0.2 `2019-03-13` Added Kanako route, improved patcher
+ v0.1 `2019-03-07` First version with Hotaru and Twins routes

#### Description
This patch will apply *partial* English translation to the *Japanese* edition  
of the この大空に、翼をひろげて FLIGHT DIARY.  
Should work with the one released on `2013-01-25`  
Disc image MD5: `69507041D04277FF93F9C5EEBB6BA942`

Only Hotaru, Twins and Kanako routes are supported!  
Interface is not translated. H-scenes are not translated.  
Patch uses Moenovel's fanfic... I mean translation as a base, but it was quite  
loosely matched. Be prepared that what you see on the screen may be not  
what characters actually say. Mostly around (but not limited to) H-scenes.

Patch instructions: just install everything. No cracks should be needed.  
Should be compatible with original savedata.  
If you used previous version of the patch, clean install is recommended.
