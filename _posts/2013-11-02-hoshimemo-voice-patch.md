This patch will replace original Chinami's voice by Minazuki Ren
to the new version by Fujimori Yukina.  

Supported Hoshimemo edition: `[2009-03-27] 「星空のメモリア-Wish upon a shooting star-」`  
It doesn't mater whether you have official updates and/or English patch
installed or not. However the main point of this patch is to have English
translation and a new voice together.
