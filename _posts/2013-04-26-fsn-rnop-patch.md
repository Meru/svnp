Below you can download a patch that adds 3 openings from Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua] (PS2)
to the original PC version and replaces 2 existing OPs with better-quality alternative.  

At first this patch used videos from PS2, but in its latest version Blu-ray
sources are used instead. This also allowed to increase resolution from 640x480
to 800x600 for all openings, including 2 original ones.  

This patch is designed to work with Realta Nua Conversion Patch v4.2+ and should
be installed on top of it. Otherwise it would probably break stuff.  
Also you want to make sure that both of these Realta Nua patches are applied on
top of the English translation by mirror moon, because they all share some components.  
Something like this:  
Original Fate <- Translation by mirror moon <- RealtaNua Conversion Patch <- RealtaNua OP Patch v6  

```2013-04-26 - v6 Released```
